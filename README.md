Don't waste time organizing things for the next you get lost.

Git-roulette will take a Github user's name and randomly choose a repository
with the `--gh` option:

```
$ python git-roulette --gh lsrdg
iscrap
```
Now, just go work on that project, delete it, rewrite, reread, write
documentation, toast, cry, just be creative.

If you are feeling really bothered you can get a list of a user's repositories.
Maybe for reference, or maybe you just find something interesting.

GitRoulette will take a Github user's name and list all of its repositories with
the `--ghl` argument:

```
$ python git-roulette --ghl lsrdg
bashscripts
cirkoan
deoplete.nvim
dotfiles... etc
```
